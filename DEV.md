# üõ†Ô∏è Developer documentation

This is a documentation file for Bookmarks developers.

## Development environment setup

This section describes how to setup your development environment.

This project requires the following tools:

- [Act]
- [Commitlint]
- [fish_indent]
- [Lefthook]
- [Markdownlint]

Install Lefthook:

```shell
lefthook install
```

## Design decisions

This section describes some explicit design decisions for this tool.

### On CSV

Bookmarks uses CSV as the file format for BFDIRS to reuse. Its desirable
benefits are:

- It's a human-readable format.
- I can easily reuse available tools ([csvkit]) to parse and query the file.

Using a custom format ala [Fishmarks][fishmarks] would mean having to implement
custom parsing and formatting logic for no benefit.

Having to depend on an external tool is not a problem for me.

### On encoding

I allow arbitrary strings in values, because paths can be arbitrary strings.
Fortunately, it's relatively easy to encode any string in CSV.

I don't allow arbitrary string keys, so that Bookmarks can run quick regexp
searches over it without worrying about escaping anything.
